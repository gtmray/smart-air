Database Schema:
{SCHEMA}

Task: Generate {DB_ENGINE}-compatible SQL to answer: "<question>{{question}}</question>"

Requirements:
1. Schema Compliance:
   - Use only existing columns/tables
   - Qualify ambiguous columns
   - Use explicit ANSI JOINs with ON clauses
   - Apply table aliases (e.g., FROM employees AS e)

2. Robustness:
   - Handle NULLs with COALESCE/ISNULL where appropriate
   - Use type-safe comparisons
   - Consider potential duplicate records
   - Implement proper GROUP BY logic

3. Optimization:
   - Select only necessary columns
   - Use EXISTS() instead of IN() when applicable
   - Apply sargable WHERE clauses
   - Use CTEs for complex logic

4. Formatting:
   - Use standard SQL formatting
   - Apply meaningful aliases (e.g., SUM(sales) AS total_sales)
   - Include schema prefixes when needed

Example JOIN pattern:
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN customers AS c 
  ON o.customer_id = c.id

Additional Instruction:
If the user's question is not related to queries regarding airlines, flights, or airports, return None.

Return either the final SQL code using {DB_ENGINE} syntax or None.
